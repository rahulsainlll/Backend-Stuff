# TCP 3-Way Handshake

The TCP handshake is a process that establishes a connection btw two tcp/ip network. It's a three-step process involving the client and the server: 

1. SYN(Synchronize): The client sends a SYN packet to the server, indicating its intention to establish a connection. This packet contains the initial sequence number (ISN) that the client chooses for the connection.

2. SYN-ACK(Synchronize-Acknowledge): upon receiving the SYN package, if the server is available and willing to establish a connection, it responds with a SYN-ACK package. The package acknowledges the client's SYN packet and includes the server's own initial sequence number.

3. ACK (Acknowledge): Finally, the client responds to the server's SYN-ACK packet with an ACK packet. This packet acknowledges the server's initial sequence number, and the connection is established.
