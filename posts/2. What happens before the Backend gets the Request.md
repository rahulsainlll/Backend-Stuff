# Before the backend receives the request

When we send a request to a backend most of us focus on the processing aspect of the request which is really just the last step.

There is so much more happening before a request is ready to be processed. I break this into 6 steps, each step can theoretically be executed by a dedicated thread or process. Pretty much all backends, web servers, proxies, frameworks and even databases have to do all these steps and they all do choose to do it differently.
